# KTL Kill To Live

## Concept

The idea of this game is too make a fun 3rd parson shooter using only cubes and blocky textures. The common theme I feel allowed for a focus on the actual gameplay. The game is played entirely with the mouse. It was made with Unity and is a small scale 3d shooter played entirely with the mouse. Your goal is to survive as long as possible.
